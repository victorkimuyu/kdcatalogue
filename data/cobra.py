    "The Play is the most versatile kayak available today! Designed for just about everyone! Perfect as a first kayak that your child can ACTUALLY PADDLE themselves. The Play is lightweight and compact, simple to transport, load and unload and can be quickly launched and easily maneuvered. Stability is provided by a shallow V-shaped hull that enhances maneuverability and tracking. The clean deck design, comfortable cockpit area and rounded ergonomic shapes make it easy to use. Three different foot positions for different length legs make it an excellent choice for sharing by the whole family or a group of friends.",

    "The Escape is the perfect sit on top kayak to throw in the water at a moment’s notice for a paddle, a float,  or a sunset. It’s perfect for children and average sized adults. All in all, the Cobra Escape is a knock out of a kayak. Extremely stable to paddle, yet nimble and easy to handle and manoeuvre. The Cobra Escape provides all the features of the big yaks, in a package small enough for lighter paddlers to use and weighs it at just over 40lbs.",

    "We think that our Cobra Explorer is as close as you can get to the perfect all-purpose kayak. Stable and fast with superb tracking, it is versatile for all sizes, shapes and varying expertise of paddlers. A great day trip kayak for exploring those hard to get to inshore caves and coves. An oversized external rear tank well holds all types of sports gear or picnic supplies. For fishing and camping there is a flush foredeck with plenty of space for your gear. The Cobra Explorer is a totally self-bailing kayak, providing for a dry ride. Its stable 31″ beam makes it a good ride for everyone.",

    "The Cobra Tandem at only 50lbs is one of the lightest two-seaters on the market, which makes it far more manageable than other tandems and can be easily loaded on top of the car. The Cobra Tandem is well known for durability, stability and manoeuvrability. It offers a fast and fun-filled ride for two. The top deck allows for a both a forward and a rear seat.  The Tandem’s width and loading capacity means the middle can accommodate a child or canine companion. The large deck space on the Tandem means there is plenty of storage room for weekend expeditions.",

    "The Cobra Tandem Long Reach is an excellent extended range large kayak with two main seating positions and a extended central deck. This huge flat deck provides tons of storage both above and below the deck. Alternatively there is plenty of room for a 3rd adult to sit comfortably in the center seating position. At 35″  wide, there is loads of stability, yet it is easy to paddle and maneuver.  With it’s two flushmount rod holders this is also the perfect 2 person fishing kayak.",

    "The Cobra Fish n’ Dive is a multi-platform fishing kayak. Ideal for day fishing, the kayak features one centrally located seat and a smaller reverse companion jump seat near the bow for another passenger or additional gear. There is no other kayak on the market this size that offers as much storage space with a hatch and a large well is located in the stern and holds up to three tanks. Scuba divers love this unique arrangement that allows for heavy loads and provides a stable exit and re-entry platform. The Cobra Fish ‘n Dive is designed to handle loads of up to 600lbs. The perfect toy for big boys who love fish but want the comfort and stability of a larger kayak – but one that also paddles well.",

    "The Pro Fisherman is designed for those long reach fishing journeys and at 13 ft with a narrower beam, the glide characteristics of this boat means it tracks effortlessly, can handle open sea conditions more efficiently and with a  rudder, is highly manoeuvrable. The flat deck space allows a number of  hatches  and if you add a pump to the sealed compartment towards the rear of the boat, then you can create a live well. For those looking towards diving exploits, the main tank well can hold a dive bottle or overnight camping gear",

    "If you are a surfer and you want a break from a stand-up board, check out the Strike. The Strike is a radical surf machine designed to ride waves. It is forgiving for novices, challenging for intermediates, and it totally rips for experts. The Strike has two revolutionary built-in ridges running lengthwise underneath along the rail that increase speed and improve turning. Its low volume reduces drag and the slim, narrow profile and exaggerated rocker increases mobility. To put it simply, it shreds."
