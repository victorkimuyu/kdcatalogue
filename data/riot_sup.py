    "Lets forget for a moment that this is the lightest plastic board on the market, making it easy for women and kids to carry. Lets ignore the fact that its small size makes it easy to transport and store. And we certainly should consider the fact that is is one of the fastest and straightest paddling 9′ boards on the market. What we want to talk about is just how much fun this little board is to paddle. Whether you’re playing on this board at the lake cabin, messing about in waves at the beach, or just enjoying an afternoon paddle, this board is just plain fun!",

    "The effortless glide you feel as the board skims across the surface is as exciting as it is effective. If you want to do more than just paddle about in circles, then this is the board you’ve been waiting for. The almost unbreakable construction means that you can lug all the fishing, hunting or diving gear you need without ever worrying about damaging it. The weight carrying capacity of this board also makes it ideal for larger paddlers, or parents wanting to take kids on board with them without overloading the hull",

    "The Streetfighter  looks much more like a “creeking kayak” than a SUP, and thats because these shapes are proven to work.  The flip up skeg doesn’t hang up on rocks throwing you off like a normal fin does, and our “Boof Buddy” allows you to hook a foot under for sticking drops, without the risk of entrapment. Made from the same tough stuff as river kayaks, the Streetfighter can take everything you throw at it – AND it’s 30% lighter than the other plastic boards out there.",

    "Whether it’s a parent with a kid, and session of Yoga, or the kids using the board as a dive platform, the Namaste answers this need perfectly. The Namaste has our unique non chaffing pad that eliminates rash from doing yoga moves (or simply sun tanning or messing about on board as many families do). The deck is lightly concave from tip to tail increasing balance, giving you a more positive feel while in movement, and reducing wobble. This same recess makes it easier for children (and dogs) to stay comfortably on board  while paddling.",

    "The Doppler allows you to paddle it keeping feet dry and secure knowing you’re spending your day paddling, not swimming after your board. Its Thermoformed construction means you don’t have to baby it like you would an epoxy board, while still keeping the overall weight at an acceptable level. If you’re looking for one board that thuly does it all, from fitness paddling, to excursions with your kid on board, to fishing and even messing about in some waves, you’ve found the right board",
